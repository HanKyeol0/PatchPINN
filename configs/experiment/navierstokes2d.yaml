domain:
  x: [-1.0, 1.0]
  y: [-1.0, 1.0]
  t: [0.0, 1.0]

# Patch configuration
patch:
  x: 5   # points per patch in x
  y: 5   # points per patch in y
  t: 3   # points per patch in time

# Grid configuration (total points)
grid:

# Stride for overlapping patches (optional)
stride:
  x: 1   # same as patch.x means non-overlapping
  y: 1   # same as patch.y means non-overlapping
