    Patch sampler on a rectangular 2D domain.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch_x, patch_y : int
        Number of points per patch in each dimension. 
        A patch with patch_x=3, patch_y=3 contains 3Ã—3=9 points.
    grid_x, grid_y : int
        Total number of grid points along each axis.
        E.g., grid_x=30 means 30 points along x-axis.

    Returns
